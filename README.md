# Hero Builder!

Welcome to the best, and only, Hero Building website!
In this site you'll be able to login to your own account.
From there you'll be able to start creating your own Heros that would fit into a MOBA setting,
such as League of Legends, DOTA, or Heros of the Storm.
To create a new Hero, just click the Build new hero button.
Then you'll have a selection of different images you can choose from for your Hero.
The hero Stats sheet is filled out with the lowest settings initially.
You can change them at will to create different types of heros, including the classic
Trinity of Roles: A high health, high defense tank. A fast, high damage and low health attacking hero. Or 
a supportive hero. The possibilities are endless!

In future additions, Hero stats will be bought with points to create balanced stats. This feature
will feel very familiar to anyone who has created a Dungeons and Dragons character before.

Then, after you've created a Hero or more, try your hand at creating abilities!
Every hero needs good abilities if they're going to win the battle.
Every ability also needs enough flexibility to really be creative.
That's why when creating abilities you're able to toggle many options on and off.
Resource usage, Cooldowns, Charges, Channel Times. You're even able to declare
an ability as an Ultimate ability, signifying that the statistics for that one are
probably more powerful then regular ones.

As with Hero balancing, Ability balancing will come in the near future. The less
an ability costs, the more charges it has, etc. will increase the cost of using that
ability.

Mix and match to create truly unique combinations!

Technologies used include Python, Postgres, SQLAlchemy, WTForms, JS, React, Redux, and Docker.
